# *HealthHaven* App README

## Overview

The HealthHaven App is a Python-based desktop application designed to provide users with a personalized, *hypothetical* health insight based on their own reported data. This application allows users to input basic healthcare data and lifestyle habits to estimate the likelihood of having heart disease. The app uses machine learning models trained on historical health data to predict health risks. Users can access these insights without the need to register or share their personal data externally. 

## Features
- **Secure Data Storage:** All data entered is stored securely on the user's device and is not transmitted or shared with any other parties.
- **No Registration Required:** Users can access all functionalities without the need to create an account.
- **Machine Learning Insights:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze input data and provide health risk assessments.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design makes it easy for everyone to input their data and receive immediate feedback.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Program:** Available on this GitHub repository, download and install the program on your desktop.
2. **Enter Your Data:** Run the script and respond to the health questionnaire. You will be asked about your demographics, behavioral choices, and health characteristics. No measuring devices, resources, or medical background are necessary.
3. **Receive Insights:** Get an immediate insight into your hypothetical risk for heart disease.


## Data and Methodology
The application's predictions are based on machine learning models that have been trained using data from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2015. The models analyze patterns and correlations from historical data to estimate health outcomes. This iteration of the program is solely focused on heart disease.

## Disclaimer
This app is intended to provide general health insights and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The application provides estimates based on correlation–not causation–and therefore should be used as a tool for awareness and not as a definitive medical assessment. Always seek the advice of your physician or another qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. By downloading and running this application, you release the creators of this program from legal liability and acknowledge the exploratory use-case of this application.

## Privacy
We prioritize your privacy:
- **Data Security:** Your data remains on your device and is never sent to or shared with any servers or external entities.
- **Control:** You have full control over your data, with the ability to delete it at any time.
